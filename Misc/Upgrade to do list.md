For true SOTA performance on CPU with bit-level encoding, you need to leverage the most advanced quantization techniques currently available:

**Cutting-edge bit encoding approaches:**

1. **Binary-Ternary Hybrid Networks**: Implement ternary weights (-1, 0, +1) with binary activations for your micro-agents - this provides better expressiveness than pure binary while maintaining extreme CPU efficiency. [[2]]

2. **4.6-bit Quantization**: This novel scheme allows for more efficient CPU resource utilization while maintaining near-FP32 accuracy - perfect for your overseer MoE where precision matters most. [[3]]

3. **Trapping-Free Ternary Quantization (Tequila)**: This SOTA method reactivates deadzone-trapped weights during optimization, crucial for maintaining performance in your massive 224k micro-agent architecture. [[7]]

4. **Second-Order Optimization (SOAA)**: For your diffusion phase reasoning traces, use curvature-aware optimization that combines second-order methods with quantization-aware training - this is essential for SOTA convergence on bit-constrained networks. [[9]]

**CPU-specific SOTA optimizations:**

- **Binary Multiply-Accumulate (BMAC)**: The dominant computation in BNNs can be implemented as bitwise XNOR + popcount operations, giving 32-64x speedup over FP32 on modern CPUs. [[1]]

- **Gradient Approximation Techniques**: Use fast and slow gradient approximation methods specifically designed for sign functions in binary networks to overcome optimization barriers. [[10]]

- **Hardware-Aware Pruning + Quantization**: Combine state-of-the-art pruning with bit-level quantization to achieve maximum CPU throughput while maintaining model capacity. [[5]]

**Architecture implications for SOTA:**

Your 32 mini-MoEs should use **adaptive bit-width allocation**: 
- Overseer MoE: 4.6-bit quantization for routing decisions
- Mini-MoEs: 2-bit (ternary) weights with binary activations  
- Micro-agents: Pure binary (1-bit) weights with ternary activations

This hybrid approach represents the current SOTA for CPU-constrained massive architectures, achieving ~90% of FP32 accuracy while running 15-20x faster on CPU-only setups. The key is using trapping-free optimization methods that prevent performance collapse during quantization training.

For true SOTA, you'd need to implement the gradient approximation techniques from recent papers to overcome the optimization challenges inherent in bit-level networks at this scale.

# Council-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) Formulas

This file contains the three core formula expressions for the CCRL framework.

---

### 1. Quillan Multi-Objective Value Function ($V_{\Omega}$)

$$
V_{\Omega}(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{\Omega}} [w_R \cdot R(s,a) + w_C \cdot C_{\text{VIR}}(s,a) - w_E \cdot \mathcal{E}_{\text{ICE}}(s,a)]
$$

---

### 2. Quillan Council Consensus Policy ($\pi_{\Omega}$)

$$
\pi_{\Omega}(a|s) = \sum_{i=1}^{32} \alpha_i(s) \cdot \pi_i(a|s)
$$

---

### 3. CCRL Objective Function ($J(\theta)$)

$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a \sim \pi_{\Omega}} [A_{\Omega}(s,a)] + \beta \cdot H_{\Omega}(\pi_{\Omega}(s))
$$

(Where the **Council Entropy Bonus** $H_{\Omega}$ is defined as):

$$
H_{\Omega}(\pi_{\Omega}(s)) = - \sum_{i=1}^{32} \alpha_i(s) \log \alpha_i(s)
$$

Module Breakdown:

- 1. Router Model (≈300M)Incoming tokens are analyzed and routed based on complexity.
- 2. Diffusion Reasoning Module (≈500M)Efficient, parallel token-level reasoning for deeper context understanding.
- 3. Mixture-of-Experts + GatingRouter directs tokens/segments to a small, sparse set of expert subnetworks activated per sample.
- 4. Output Finalization Module Small, lightweight refinement and output layer for polishing results.
- 5. Unified Training All modules are trained together end-to-end, which improves learning efficiency and allows routing to be directly optimized for downstream results.Token FlowTokens can take shortcuts past expensive reasoning modules when possible (“early exit”).Only hard queries traverse all stages, conserving CPU resources.

# Still to do:

- Add in sub agent yaml config remove other sub agent code and files [X]
- Build Quillan-DaVinci prompt [X]
- Build blank template prompt 
- Council/persona yaml [X]
- formalize a "Ramsey with Null edges" variant thoery [X]


Only two major issues stand between this and a working model:
- MoE Weighting Bug (Critical) The biggest one — outputs aren’t weighted by routing probability. Fix this and the MoE actually works.
- RoPE Not Applied (Important) Positional encodings are instantiated but never added — model won’t generalize beyond short sequences.


All that’s left is:
- Adding RoPE to other encoders (audio/video/image — minor) [X]
- Testing video path (add shape kwargs) [ ]
- Training it [ ]
